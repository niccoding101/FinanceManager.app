# FinanceManager.app

This is a basic scaffold for your Personal Finance Manager app in Swift. Each component can be expanded with additional features and logic as needed. For instance, more sophisticated machine learning models can be implemented for better financial advice, and the UI can be improved for a better user experience. The above code also assumes the presence of some boilerplate setup for Core Data and UI elements, which you'll need to set up in your Xcode project.
